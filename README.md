# cmps112

## Synopsis

This class taught students comparative languages that aren't commonly used anymore. In this directory, I have  completed the class programming assignments respectively in /asg#/code.

## Installation

Students would use a terminal such as macOS Terminal or Putty (Windows) to do projects, get files, and submit projects to be graded from:
http://www2.ucsc.edu/courses/cmps112-wm/:/
This website may require a login which is known mainly only to students and instructors.

I have provided the assignments and their completed code in their respective directory /asg#/code.
They all require their our programming language which students indicate with a hashbang or indicate it in their .bash_profile/ .bashrc.

Example: 
,,,
In the mzscheme program
#!/afs/cats.ucsc.edu/courses/cmps112-wm/usr/racket/bin/mzscheme -qr
,,,
,,,
In our .bash_profile/ .bashrc
export PATH=$PATH:/afs/cats.ucsc.edu/courses/cmps112-wm/usr/ocaml/bin
export PATH=$PATH:/afs/cats.ucsc.edu/courses/cmps112-wm/usr/racket/bin
export PATH=$PATH:/afs/cats.ucsc.edu/courses/cmps112-wm/usr/gprolog/bin
,,,
## Tests

Our professor provided usually provides us a mk.tests file or a testrun file which we run to test. You can find this in /.score OR /code
